2. load rule table to memory 																	  checked
3. generate translation hypothesis for a span with normal rule,including
   3.1 generate all possible patterns for a source span 										  checked
   3.2 match each pattern in rule table 														  checked
   3.3 generate translation hypothesis according to the target side of each matched pattern       checked

find hiero rules for each span before decoding                                                    checked
check boundary index for each rule pattern
calculate log prob when converting rule table to bin
